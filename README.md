## PREFACE: WHY AKX3

The **AKX3** idea is coming from a blockchain project back in 2017 when ICOs were all the rage. We were known back then as *Kryptopy Inc*. and we wanted to make something new and disruptive. The whole idea which was new back then was to develop a social network on Ethereum that is efficient and that does provide trade-copying features similar to *eToro*. (eToro does support cryptocurrency now but it didn't in 2017). People liked the project so much that we ended up being nominated as **Blockchain Startup of the Year**. That was also the year of "*cryptokitty*", scaling problems, security problems and massive hacks that did occur on the **Ethereum mainnet**. Those events made us rethink our project and refund our backers fully as it was proof that the Ethereum ecosystem wasn't ready back then for such a project. 

Then crypto winter and the December 2017 infamous crypto crash came. A lot of people thought it was the end for cryptocurrencies and blockchain altogether. However, some very passionate developers, past project founders and the main blockchains (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc) back then started to evolve quickly. 

Likewise, instead of calling it quit, Nicolas Cloutier, former Kryptopy's CEO, took those events as an opportunity to go back to the drawing board and regroup.

During that time, he did experiment with many blockchain concepts, drew and developed ideas to find solutions to various problems. One of his most notable work is a pseudo-quantum resistant key algorithm based on the concept of the infinite monkey theorem and natural selection coupled with machine learning. If all of that seems too esoteric for you it's more than ok as it is far out of the scope of this paper. While working on discovering new concepts as well as helping the DOGE community he discovered that the main problem in the blockchain / cryptocurrency / defi industry is not technical but of human nature.

### Problem #1 Wen Rich? (typo is on purpose)

Without a doubt, since 2017 a lot of millionaires were created by the blockchain industry and trading cryptocurrencies, especially amongst early adopters. Just like the firsts people to invest in IBM, Microsoft, Apple in the 70's .. they are all wealthy today. If you were to invest in the same stocks today, chances are it will take you decades if ever to be as wealthy as those people. Let's be realistic. It won't happen. Those people were at the right place at the right time. So were early cryptocurrency investors. 

But why can't we all be rich? Isn't it what cryptocurrency are made for? Everybody rich? Everybody lambo? If you are new to the industry you might not recognize those sentences but people who have been in it for only a few months will.

The answer is simple and to illustrate it let's think about a ladder. Bottom is poor, top is rich. If you remove all the steps of the ladder, the ladder is useless because everyone is at the top already. Well, in fact there is no more top or bottom. 

To be able to compare rich and poor you need a top and bottom. It is very unfair. However if everyone is "rich" ... nice, poor doesn't exist anymore. But then how do we know when someone is rich? We will look at the richest person of the richs people around us and take it as the top of "rich" and the poorest richest person and take it as the bottom of "rich". We created a new scale and the poorest rich become poor and richests "normal". It is a full circle and it never ends. The end result is an infinite economic cycle like we know today: Abundance - Inflation - Recession. 

A lot of blockchain projects are based on that skewed idea of making everybody rich. Influencers market it as such, developers market it as such and a lot of people buy it. This leads to deception, scams and a lot of negativity within large communities as well as the mainstream medias. 

To take the infamous words of one of the top meme coin founder: "Trading crypto is gambling (...) the only solution is gonna come from education.". While we agree with him, to educate people you need to make them want to be educated.

AKX3 wants to bring solutions to that very hard problem via various initiatives that we believe will help the industry be healthier and go mainstream faster. One of the more obvious solution is to **enhance communication with the "less industry educated" public** by making the technology more accessible and appealing to them while removing greed from the equation. That is something we keep in mind and at the center of everything we do.
